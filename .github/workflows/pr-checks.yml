# TODO: Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
# Sets up pip and python
#  Runs all checks:
#    - Install dependencies from requirements-dev.txt
#    - Run tests
#    - Check code formatting
#    - Run type checking
#    - Run linting

# Hint: Use make check-all command, also use action: https://www.github.com/actions/setup-python/tree/v4/

# As you progress, only uncomment lines that are needed depending on where you are in the project.
